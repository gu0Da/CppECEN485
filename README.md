## CppECEN485
Independent study in learning C++

The files here represent the work for a 1 credit hour summer class, and are listed below in order of creation.

All files were written in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

####Cpp Practice
This program is a very basic implementation of a Morse code translator. It simply takes in a single letter input and returns its Morse code equivalent.

####Morse Translator
This program is a more efficient and faster implementation of the Morse code translator. It is able to take a string as an input and output the Morse Code Equivalent

####Morse Translator While
This program is identical to the previous one, except that it uses a while loop instead of a for loop.

####Letter Counter
This program takes a text file as an input, and outputs the number of occurences of each letter and symbol in the input file.
The output for this can be seen [here.](http://imgur.com/a/yAxqF)

####Orbit Simulator
This program is a very basic orbit simulation. It outputs a text file with the coordinates of the Earth for a two-body Earth-Sun system, with the Sun being a fixed body.
